<p>My main research interests are in the fields of <b>Data Science</b>

 working with machine learning and AI. I'd like to make computers do more with less help from humman, learn from experience.

</p>

<h3> About Enoc </h3>
<p>
	I am a Junior Computer Science Student with a focus on Artificial Intelligence, at Salem State University, where I took part on my first undergraduate research project "Discovering The Hidden Connections Between Individuals" as well becoming the Vice President of our new Programming Club.

My goal is to keep learning new things everyday as well as serve as a positive influence, especially to the Hispanic and Latin American Community where Computer Science doesn't have a huge presence.

I believe if you can dream it, you can achieve it, so let's start building the future.
</p>

<h3> Presentation </h3>
<p>The joy of learning and lots of questions! Also,during the COVID-19 pandemic, all in-person workshops will be suspended with some adapted to be presented virtually via Zoom. However, please check back as more workshops will be added to this page.These highly interactive, virtual learning opportunities aren’t your same old dry meetings. They’re built on collaboration, which means they keep your participants engaged (and, you know, awake).
