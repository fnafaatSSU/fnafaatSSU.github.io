  <h1>Undergraduate Data Science Research Group</h1>
  <h2>Research Overview</h2>
      <p>Welcome to our research group! We specialize in Data Science (Machine Learning and AI). Our current projects include:</p>
      <ul>
      	<strong>
        <li>Text Summarization</li>
        <li>Machine learning and Probabilistic Graphical Models</li>
        <li>Deep Learning Techniques</li>
        <li>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</li>
        <li>Responsible for the engineering of AI</li>
        <li>Semantic Computing based on Eye-tracking</li>
        <li>Web Programming and Complex Network Analysis</li>
    </strong>
      </ul>
   <p>
    The group was established in <strong> Fall 2020</strong> during the COVID-19 pandemic by <strong>Dr. Nafa </strong> and a group of Computer Science students.
    The group has participated in <strong>the Massachusetts Undergraduate Research Conference </strong> and has had  formal papers accepted for publication at <strong> 8th International Conference on Bioinformatics & Biosciences (BIOS 2022) October 29 ~ 30, 2022, Vienna, Austria</strong> , marking the first time Computer Science students have had papers published online.
  </p>
  <h2>How to join!</h2>
      <p>To join the Data Science undergraduate research group, send an email expressing your interest in topics such as Data Science, AI, Machine Learning, Semantic Computing, and Web Programming to <strong>Dr. Nafa</strong> at <strong>fnafa@salemstate.edu </strong>Upon receipt of your email, you will receive a welcome message and be introduced to the group members. New members are required to complete a tutorial during their first semester, based on their learning pace. After mastering the basics, members are free to choose a research topic or join a team. The group meets weekly to present progress on research projects, with members who have been with the group for at least two semesters. </p>
